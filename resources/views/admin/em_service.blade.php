        <h3>Caveats :</h3>

        <p>  Bullseye Underground Utility Locating Service L.L.C. adheres to Dig Safe, Call Before You Dig (CBYD) or your local one-call center's laws and regulations. We utilize (NULCA), the National Utility Locating Contractors Association's best practices and guidelines for correct underground utility location methods. Bullseye will delineate using paint and flags along with available underground plant plans and topical evidence and mark requested locatable privately owned underground facilities located at your site. Bullseye specializes in locating and identifying any item placed below ground for use in connection with the conveyance of water, sewage, telephone or fiber optic communications, electric energy, oil, gas or other substances. For example, pipes, sewers, conduits, cables, valves, lines, wires, manholes, and empty conduit. We only locate facilities that convey gas, oil, fuels, toxic materials, explosive materials, and environmentally damaging products for survey purpose only not intended for excavation purposes.

            We do not mark irrigation, plastic pipes, septic tanks, leach fields, Underground fuel storage, or any tank below ground. Bullseye Underground Utility Locating uses electromagnetic line location (EMLL). These techniques are used to locate the electromagnetic field resulting from an electric current flowing on a line. These fields can arise from currents already on the line (known as passive or ambient signals) or currents applied to a line with a transmitter (active). The most common passive signals are generated by live electric lines, grounded water lines, and re-radiated radio signals. Active signals can be introduced onto conductive utilities by directly connecting the transmitter to the line at accessible locations, causing the signal to travel along the utility. This is referred to as electromagnetic conduction (EMC). Additionally, a signal can be introduced onto a line through electromagnetic induction (EMI). This involves transmitting a high-frequency electromagnetic field through the air with the transmitter placed on the ground surface in close proximity to the utility. Alternately, an induction clamp can be placed around specific metallic conduits in vaults or breaker boxes. The detection of underground utilities is dependent upon the composition and construction of the line of interest. Utilities detectable with standard line location techniques include most continuously connected metal pipes, cables/wires or non-metallic utilities equipped with tracer wires. These generally include water, electric, natural gas, telephone, and other conduits related to facility operations. If there are no passive currents present, then these utilities must be exposed at the surface or accessible in utility vaults in order to have an active signal placed on them.

            Utilities that are not detectable using standard electromagnetic line location techniques include those made of non-electrically conductive materials such as PVC, fiberglass, vitrified clay and metal pipes with insulating joints. Bullseye will attempt to place traceable material within the unlocatable pipe or conduit if access allows in order to induce a signal. The electromagnetic (EM) locating equipment we use to locate metallic pipes and or cables provides us with a range of frequencies necessary in a survey. Having the choice of frequencies at-hand gives us the ability to adjust to the unforeseen soil conditions as well as pipe/cable conditions which can be encountered unexpectedly on the job-site. The equipment also provides continuous depth-estimates to help confirm target conductors in which, secondly, can be applied for excavation and design information. A measure of accuracy varies allowing a hand dig tolerance of 28 inches on either side of the utility-line mark out to the full depth of excavation. Depth-readings from equipment display are available upon request, however, they have their limitations and may not be accurate or relied upon for any purposes.

        <h3>GPR Locating (Locate and Mark)</h3>
        <p> Bullseye Locating uses LMX200 ground-penetrating radar equipment to perform utility locate services. Bullseye uses the locate and mark technique this is the most common way of using GPR to track utilities. It is very similar to the use of traditional methods of tracking and detecting utility. The GPR sensor is moved along sweeps perpendicular to the anticipated utility axis. Bullseye Locating moves the GPR back and forth while marking the ground where the top of the hyperbola is observed, the alignment of the subsurface utility can be traced out and marked once a linear feature is detected. GPR systems that operate in the 100 to 500 MHz frequency range offer the best compromise between spatial resolution and exploration depth. The LMX200 system provides an excellent example of a GPR system optimized for utility locating. Other direct approaches for utility detection like EM locating or to trench, hand dig, or vacuum excavate to expose features. Any prior knowledge of underground, underground plans and accurate as-built drawings are recommended to be effective with these techniques. GPR is not without its limitations. GPR radio wave signals are absorbed by the ground with some soils (clays, saline) greatly limiting exploration depth. GPR effectiveness is thus site-specific and varies greatly from place to place.
        </p>
        <h3>GPR Data Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive testing method used to locate materials such as concrete, plastic, metal, steel, rock, soil, ice, and pavement. At Bullseye Utility Locating LLC, we use the latest GPR technology to provide critical information on utilities, structural elements and other potential obstructions underground. Because depth of exploration is dependent upon the electrical properties of material(s) inspected and interpretations are opinions based on judgments made from those acquired radar signals and/or other data, Bullseye Utility Locating LLC does not guarantee the accuracy or correctness of interpretations and Bullseye Utility Locating LLC will not accept liability or responsibility for any loss, damage, or expense that may be incurred or sustained by any services or interpretations performed by Bullseye Utility Locating LLC. Even though, Bullseye Utility Locating LLC uses what we believe to be the best technology available in the market for Utility Location we cannot detect every buried utility. A buried line or pipe must conduct an electronic signal, transmitted by our equipment, to be accurately detected. At job sites, there will more than likely be subsurface utilities that cannot be detected, and many times utilities pass through a site without an above ground access point or giving any other indication that they are there. Our friendly and knowledgeable staff is always available to explain any limitations as they pertain to your site. For these reasons, Bullseye Utility Locating LLC is not responsible for any nonconductive lines (Non-Metallic, PVC, Water Line, Etc.) and for any conductive lines with no accessible connection point or those that do not appear on blueprints, maps, or as-builts provided by the customer prior to locating. Bullseye Utility Locating LLC is not responsible for any loss or damage arising out of the use of, or reliance on the data collected or the report presented.

        <h3>Boring clearing or staking location details</h3>
        <p>   Bullseye Underground Utility Locating cannot 100% clear a boring or stake locations of all utilities. Bullseye can identify and locate utilities running in a projected boring or stake location. This is done by examining print information provided by the customer, topical evidence and any information gained at the dig site. Excavator should always take extreme caution when driving/pounding in stakes, drilling or boring at a location after it is it is marked. Bullseye utilizes techniques such as (EM) Electromagnetic line tracing. This form of locating is economical but has its limitations. Even though all utility locating techniques has its limitations Bullseye does recommend GPR locating techniques along with (EM) to gain more formation before driving stakes, boring or excavating.
